A-To-Be Challenge App

The main goald was to retrieve products from https://dummyjson.com/docs/products and list them in a table view and navigate to a description view when select the row.

Some rules where applyed:
- Fetch data only on the first run
- The data must be save localy
- The table view must display an image of the product, the title and rating
- The image should be different based on the rating
- Must have a detail view
- The detail view must show the description of the product, title, rating, price, discount percentage, and stock

Some points to be checked and improved
- All the images are using URLSession to download and display. Its will be better to same them but not the image itself, that will increase the app size
